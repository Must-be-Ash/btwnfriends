# Getting Help

### How can I see the activity (userOperations, sponsored transactions, etc.) for my project?

The Paymaster tool offers two main views for tracking your project:

* **Analytics:** Provides an overview of your sponsorships with graphs showing user operations, unique wallets, and total gas sponsoredâ€”a great way to gauge your application's performance.
* **Logs:** Displays requests sent to your Paymaster and Bundler Endpoint (see our [API documentation](/api-reference/json-rpc-api/core). This view is also useful for troubleshooting unexpected behavior. You can export userOperations from either tab.

### Can I use other third party bundlers with the Base Paymaster?

Currently, our paymaster is designed to function exclusively with our Bundler. This approach ensures the safest and most reliable developer experience, along with consistent uptime and service quality.

Developers using our Paymaster + Bundler can take advantage of our Paymaster Credits program enabling you to [sponsor up to \$15K](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yPnBFW0bVUNLUN_w3ctCqYM9sjdIQO3Typ53KXlsS5g/viewform?edit_requested=true\&pli=1) in gas across Base.
