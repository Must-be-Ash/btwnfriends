## 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

### Transaction Flow

1. **User Authentication**
   ```typescript
   // CDP handles email OTP and wallet creation
   const { currentUser } = useCurrentUser()
   const { evmAddress } = useEvmAddress()
   ```

2. **Recipient Lookup**
   ```typescript
   // Check if recipient exists in your user database
   const recipient = await getUserByEmail(email)
   const transferType = recipient ? 'direct' : 'escrow'
   ```

3. **Transaction Preparation**
   ```typescript
   if (transferType === 'direct') {
     // Direct USDC transfer to existing user
     return prepareUSDCTransfer(senderAddress, recipientAddress, amount)
   } else {
     // Escrow deposit + email notification
     return [
       prepareUSDCApproval(escrowAddress, amount),
       prepareEscrowDeposit(transferId, amount, emailHash)
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Gas Sponsorship**
   ```typescript
   // Admin wallet sponsors gas for recipient claims
   const adminRelease = await prepareAdminRelease(transferId, recipientEmail, recipientAddress)
   await sendTransactionFromAdmin(adminRelease)
   ```

### Database Schema

```typescript
interface User {
  userId: string        // CDP user ID
  email: string        // Verified email address
  evmAddress: string   // Wallet address
  displayName?: string
  createdAt: Date
}

interface Transfer {
  transferId: string
  senderEmail: string
  recipientEmail: string
  amount: string
  status: 'pending' | 'claimed' | 'refunded'
  txHash?: string

This is made by me and not an official CDP app. It's not perfect and it's not meant to be the end product though it's fully functional and production ready. I made this as your starting point so you don't have to start from scratch. It's meant to get you started to build your next idea 🤍
