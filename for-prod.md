# Security Audit Report for Production Deployment

> **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This application is currently configured for **testnet/demo purposes only**. Before deploying to production, you **MUST** address all security issues listed below.

## üîí Critical Security Issues

### 1. Authentication Vulnerabilities

#### **Issue**: Unauthenticated User Lookup Endpoints
- **Location**: `/src/app/api/users/lookup-by-address/route.ts`
- **Problem**: GET and POST endpoints return user email and display name without authentication, allowing anyone to map on-chain addresses to real-world identities
- **Fix**: Require authentication for these endpoints. Modify response to only return `{"exists": true}` unless the request is made by the user who owns the data

#### **Issue**: Unprotected Refund Endpoint
- **Location**: `/src/app/api/refund/route.ts`
- **Problem**: POST endpoint has no authentication, allowing anyone to trigger mass refunds or cause DoS attacks
- **Fix**: Protect with strong internal authentication (API key as Bearer token, IP restrictions, or Vercel Cron authentication)

### 2. Data Integrity Issues

#### **Issue**: Client-Supplied Wallet Address
- **Location**: `/src/app/api/users/route.ts` (POST)
- **Problem**: Accepts client-supplied walletAddress
- **Fix**: Derive walletAddress server-side from authenticated CDP user, normalize to lowercase, mark immutable, add unique index

#### **Issue**: Incorrect Refund Logic
- **Location**: `/src/app/api/refund/route.ts`
- **Problem**: Uses `createdAt - 7d` instead of `expiryDate`, causing premature or late refunds
- **Fix**: Select refunds by `expiryDate <= now` or verify on-chain `isRefundable` state

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Measures

### Rate Limiting
- **Issue**: No API endpoints are protected by rate limiting
- **Fix**: Implement per-IP rate limiting on sensitive endpoints using `@upstash/ratelimit`

### Input Validation
- **Issue**: Insufficient validation for transaction amounts ($1M limit), wallet address checksums, and display name characters
- **Fix**: Implement stricter Zod schemas with reasonable limits, checksum validation, and character filtering

### Database Security
- **Issue**: MongoDB injection risk from unsanitized regex queries
- **Fix**: Sanitize and escape all special regex characters from user input

- **Issue**: Lack of unique indexes creating duplicate data risk
- **Fix**: Create unique indexes on `email`, `userId`, and `transferId`

### Security Headers
- **Issue**: Missing HSTS and CSP headers
- **Fix**: Add `Strict-Transport-Security` and `Content-Security-Policy` headers in `next.config.js`

### Logic Bugs
- **Issue**: `/api/pending-claims` passes user email instead of userId to database function
- **Fix**: Pass `user.userId` instead of `user.email` to `getPendingTransfersBySender`

### Network Security
- **Issue**: Missing explicit CORS policy
- **Fix**: Add explicit CORS policy configuration

### RPC Reliability
- **Issue**: No retry mechanism for transient RPC failures
- **Fix**: Add bounded retries with backoff for RPC reliability

## üîê Smart Contract Security

### 1. Admin Key Management
- **Issue**: Single-account admin operations create risk if key is compromised
- **Fix**: Implement multisig for admin functions

### 2. Email Hashing Consistency
- **Issue**: Off-chain code lowercases emails before hashing, but on-chain `adminRelease` doesn't enforce this
- **Fix**: Ensure consistent email lowercasing in both off-chain and on-chain logic

## üìã Production Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure you have:

- [ ] Implemented authentication for all sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Added rate limiting to API endpoints
- [ ] Implemented proper input validation with Zod schemas
- [ ] Added security headers (HSTS, CSP)
- [ ] Created unique database indexes
- [ ] Fixed logic bugs in pending claims
- [ ] Implemented CORS policy
- [ ] Added RPC retry mechanisms
- [ ] Secured smart contract admin functions
- [ ] Ensured email hashing consistency
